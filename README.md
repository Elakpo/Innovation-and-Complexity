# Deaths from Cardiovascular Diseases and Types

The estimated number of deaths from cardiovascular disease by type, Germany (2009-2019).
## Key User Group
Cardiovascular disease researchers at Robert Koch-Institute (German central institution responsible for disease prevention and control)
### Key Problem
According to WHO, heart diseases and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common causes of death worldwide responsible for one third of all deaths globally. On a national scale, it is important to compare the number of CVD death by type in a period of 10 years (2009-2019) to enable the easy identification of high-risk
diseases.
### Solution
The app can be used by user group to monitor decrease or increase in CVDs in within the specified time frame in Germany. The disease comparison will help in prioritizing disease diagnosis and treatment, preventive solutions, and awareness campaigns.
